# Teeko Game
**Please look at the gameplay_images folder to see what the game looks like!**

## How to run:
1. You need Python 3+ (no guarantee with python 3.9) as well to get the game to run 
2. Install pygame - Go to your terminal and type: pip install pygame==2.0.0
3. Install numpy - Go to your terminal and type: pip install numpy==1.19.3
4. Open the code folder, run teeko.py
5. In the settings menu, you can toggle through the AI level (1 is easy, 2 is medium, 3 is hard)


## Rules:
The game starts with either you or the AI playing the first move. Both players have 4 pieces each (putting down one piece at a time). Once both players each have their 4 pieces down, you are allowed to only move your pieces (to an adjacent, empty cell). 

## Objective:
First player to get their 4 pieces in a horizontal, vertical, diagonal, or diamond configuration, wins!
