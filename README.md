Both players have 4 pieces each (putting down one piece at a time).\
Once your 4 pieces are down, you are allowed to move one piece to an adjacent, empty cell, in a given turn. 

In the settings menu, you can toggle through the AI level (1 is easy, 2 is medium, 3 is hard)

## Objective:
First player to get their 4 pieces in a horizontal, vertical, diagonal, or diamond configuration, wins!
